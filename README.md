Introduction:
The turbojet engine faces losses due to numerous factors. These losses, resulting from phenomena such as friction, incomplete combustion and diffusion inefficiencies, play a very important role in shaping the actual performance of the engine. In this assignment, we made a cycle analysis turbojet engine with losses. We used Summary of Equations-Turbojet Engine Chapter 7 formulas for calculations. We observed the effect of changing M0 values on output values.
